          I conduct user research to understand what users need and how they
          behave. By gathering insights through interviews, surveys, and
          testing, I make informed design choices that solve real problems and
          create better user experiences.

          <h4>Fish and Wildlife Service Website Redesign</h4>
          <p>
            As part of a team project, we redesigned the Fish and Wildlife
            Service website to create a more engaging, intuitive experience for
            users. Our goal was to make important conservation information and
            resources easier to access, with a clean and structured layout. By
            improving navigation, adding eye-catching visuals, and focusing on
            usability, our redesign helps users explore wildlife initiatives,
            learn about protected species, and get involved in conservation
            efforts more easily.

          <h4>The Recipe Website Redesign</h4>
          <p>
            My group and I designed and developed The Recipe website from the
            ground up to offer users a sleek, intuitive space to explore and
            save their favorite recipes. With a modern, dark aesthetic, the site
            is built to be both visually appealing and easy to navigate. Users
            can upload their own recipes or find new ones to suit their taste,
            creating a personalized digital recipe book that’s timeless and
            effortless to use.

          <h4>D.A.R.E. Website Redesign</h4>
          <p>
            For this project, me and my team redesigned the D.A.R.E. website to
            create a more user-friendly and engaging experience. My focus was on
            making information easily accessible while modernizing the look to
            appeal to a younger audience. Through clean layouts, bright visuals,
            and organized content, the new design helps users quickly find
            resources and stay connected to D.A.R.E.’s mission of drug awareness
            and prevention.
